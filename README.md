# File Input + Upload Button

This project was generated with [Angular 7.](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
It uses [Angular Material 7.](https://material.angular.io/)

- Allows easy file upload to any REST api.
- Uses Angular material design for a nicer appearance than the default file input  HTML button.
- Has no dependencies on any file upload node package for safety in deployment.
- Takes two arguemnts: `upload_url` for the api entry point, and `callback` for a function processing the api callback.
